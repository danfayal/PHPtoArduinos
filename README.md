# PHPtoArduinos
Control Arduino default boards over world wide web. Need the Windows C# API and the Arduino code (Duuuhhhh). It's a very simple showcase to a company in Brazil. If do you wanna use this project, please, create your own MySQL database and table in your own server and change the lines in PHP stuff to fit your needs about control Arduino ports. Oh! maybe you will see a few Brazilian Portuguese words in some commentary lines or even in some part of code, but don't cry: go to Google Tradutor.

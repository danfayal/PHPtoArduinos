# phpArduino
Control Arduino default boards over world wide web. Need the Windows C# API and the Arduino code (Duuuhhhh). It's a very simple showcase to a company in Brazil. If do you wanna use this project, please, create your own MySQL table in your own server and change the lines in PHP stuff to fit your needs.
